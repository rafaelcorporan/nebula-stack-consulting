# Principal Software Engineer Agent

An AI-powered Principal Software Engineer agent that provides technical leadership, architectural guidance, and mentorship capabilities.

## Features

- **Technology Evaluation**: Assess and recommend technologies based on requirements and context
- **System Design**: Create scalable and maintainable system architectures
- **Code Review**: Analyze code for quality, security, and best practices
- **Mentorship**: Provide guidance to junior and mid-level engineers
- **Technical Radar**: Track and recommend technology adoption

## Installation

```bash
pip install -e .
```

## Quick Start

```python
from principal_se.agent import PrincipalSE, ArchitecturePattern

# Initialize the agent
principal = PrincipalSE(
    name="Your Name",
    expertise=["Cloud Architecture", "Distributed Systems"],
    experience_years=10
)

# Evaluate a technology
evaluation = principal.evaluate_technology("Kubernetes", {
    "requirements": ["container orchestration", "scalability"]
})
print(f"Evaluation: {evaluation['recommendation']}")

# Generate a system design
design = principal.design_system({
    "name": "Social Media Platform",
    "scale": "large",
    "availability": "99.99%"
})

# Review code
findings = principal.review_code("def test(): pass", "python")
print(f"Found {len(findings)} issues")
```

## Examples
